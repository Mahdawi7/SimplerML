# Iterative Improvement ðŸŒŸ

Finding a good set of weights isnâ€™t the endâ€”itâ€™s just the beginning.

Machine learning's real power comes from its ability to keep adjusting and improving these weights. This process is called iterative improvement, where we continuously refine and adjust our weights to make better predictions.

This method of using random weights and then adjusting them based on actual outcomes is a foundational concept in machine learning. It allows the **Machine Learning Model** to **â€˜learnâ€™** from data and improve over time.
