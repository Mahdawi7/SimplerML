# Thousands of conditions! ü§Ø

Perfect. We‚Äôve found a set of weights that work well with our few conditions. But what if our social media model had not just three factors but hundreds or maybe thousands?

Trying to guess the right combination of weights in this situation is like finding a needle in a haystack ‚Äì actually, it‚Äôs more like finding a specific grain of sand on a beach!

## The Challenge with a huge number of conditions

**Complexity Multiplies:** With just a few conditions, it‚Äôs like juggling a few balls. But with thousands, it‚Äôs like juggling an entire circus worth of objects while blindfolded.

**Guessing Becomes Impractical:** If guessing the right combination for three conditions is like cracking a simple three-digit lock, then doing the same for thousands of conditions is like guessing the combination of a vault with a thousand dials. It‚Äôs not just difficult; it‚Äôs practically impossible!

**Computational Burden:** This isn‚Äôt just a mental challenge; it‚Äôs a computational one. The more conditions you have, the more possible combinations of weights there are, exponentially increasing the amount of time and resources needed to test each possibility.

Imagine trying to guess the WiFi password for a coffee shop that has a password composed of 100 random characters.

You sit down and start guessing: ‚Äúcoffee123‚Äù, ‚Äúbestcoffeeintown‚Äù, ‚Äúilovecoffee‚Äù‚Ä¶ As you add more characters, the likelihood of you hitting the right password by random guesses becomes laughably impossible.

It‚Äôs the same with our weights - as we add more conditions, simply guessing becomes almost impossible.

### Better Approach

Luckily, machine learning doesn't rely on guesswork.

Instead, it uses awesome algorithms to find those 'hidden' weights and patterns all by itself.

In the next chapters, we'll see how these algorithms work, one step at a time, breaking them down to ensure we understand exactly what's going on.

By the end, you will be able to use them to build your own super-powerful machine-learning models!

I can't wait to see what you create. See you in the next chapter!
