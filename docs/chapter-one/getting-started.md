We will start with a simple real-world example.

Let’s say you want to publish a post on Social Media, whether Facebook, Twitter (X), LinkedIn, or whatever…

Let’s say on **Twitter (X)**

And before you push the post button, **you want to predict if the post will go viral or not!**

Of course, we are not going to use Black magic, Fortune Tellers, or Psychics here 😅.

We will try to do so by thinking about “**conditions**” or **‘factors**” that make a post viral! That makes sense… ha!

For example, **if a post is made on a weekend**, it is likely to go viral. This is our prediction.

So we get an outcome:

- Post on Weekend = viral ✅
- Post on Weekday = Not viral ❌

_This is a straightforward condition. If the condition (posting on the weekend) is met, the outcome is a viral post._

Note that this is just a guess and has nothing to do with reality. We are just assuming that!

Somehow, a dummy prediction🤪!

Let’s be a little smarter and use multiple conditions or factors, **for example:**

- **Condition 1**: Time of the post (Morning, Afternoon, Evening).
- **Condition 2**: Length of content (character count).
- **Condition 3**: Day of the week (Weekday, Weekend).

Now, determining virality has become more complex since we want to check on multiple conditions to predict if the post will go viral or not. Yes?!

**For example:**

- Posting a 200-character post in the evening on a weekend might be viral.
- Posting 50 characters in the morning on a weekday might not be viral.

**👉 With multiple conditions, the rules become more challenging to manage.**
